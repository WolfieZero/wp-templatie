Templatie
=========

Templatie is a boilerplate for HTML and CSS using LESS that will allow for quicker development of projects. Using LESS along with various varibles and functions you can create to look however you want with minimal setup time; just pick the colours. It also introduces a structure to your LESS files to keep the development file in order so it's easier to manage what goes where.
